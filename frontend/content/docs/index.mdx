# <Icon name="Video" className="inline-block mr-2" /> Welcome to MovingLines

MovingLines is an advanced AI orchestration platform designed to generate **mathematically beautiful**, **story-driven**, and **cinematic** animations using [Manim Community Edition](https://www.manim.community/).

By leveraging **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and a custom **Agentic Workflow**, MovingLines moves beyond simple code generation to become a true **Narrative Designer**.

## <Icon name="Brain" className="inline-block mr-2" /> The "Aha!" Engine

The core of MovingLines is the "Aha!" Engine — a multi-agent system that prioritizes educational clarity and visual continuity.

- **Phased Generation**: We don't just write code; we storyboard first.
- **Progressive Revelation**: Content builds step-by-step to maximize understanding.
- **Visual Continuity**: Smooth transitions and morphs instead of static cuts.

Explore our deep-dives into the system's architecture:

### Architecture
A high-level view of how the Frontend, Backend, AI Engine, and Renderer communicate. [Learn more](/docs/architecture)

### The Narrative Planner
Learn how we transform a single sentence prompt into a detailed cinematic storyboard. [Learn more](/docs/aha-engine)

### RAG & Memory
See how we use **Pinecone** to provide the AI with high-quality, stable Manim code examples. [Learn more](/docs/rag)

### Anti-Crash Sanitizer
Our specialized engine that detects and fixes LLM hallucinations before they reach the renderer. [Learn more](/docs/sanitizers)
